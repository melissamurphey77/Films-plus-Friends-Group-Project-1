# Films + Friends
Films + Friends is a service aimed at helping users plan what movies to watch with their friends.

The user selects a genre and rating and we return 5 movies from the OMDB API that can be swapped out with any feature the user may want to search.

The information is stored in firebase along with contact info provided by the user and then assigned to an access code that is referenceable by all users to vote for their selection.

Emailjs handles sending communications out to the host and attendees and sends an initial invite email as well as a results email.

For more information, see the More information page on the site.
